# Applying NLP for topic modelling in a real-life context

Business Context:

The PureGym Group, founded in 2008, has approximately 2 million members and 600 gyms across the world (particularly in the UK, Denmark, and Switzerland). As one of the world’s largest value fitness operators, PureGym appeals to a broad range of customers by offering high-quality, low-cost, and flexible fitness facilities. The company’s customer-centric proposition – affordable membership fees, no fixed-term contracts, and 24/7 access to high-quality gyms – differentiates it from more traditional gyms and elevates it as a market leader within this space.
This focus on the customer is centred on wanting to understand what motivates members to join and what factors influence their behaviours once they have joined. Understanding how to leverage innovative technology to influence, improve, and simplify their experience allows PureGym to foster an open, welcoming, and diverse environment for its members while maintaining the value proposition that PureGym is built upon. With the shift in focus to value-for-money memberships across the gym industry, PureGym seeks to achieve its mission of ‘inspiring a healthier world by providing members with affordable access to the benefits being healthy can offer’.

Extracted actionable recommendations to address issues such as poor customer service, equipment availability, and cleanliness. Proposed targeted solutions to improve customer satisfaction, retention rates, and overall gym experience. The insights informed strategic decision-making, enhancing operational efficiency and customer loyalty.
